# NavisAI Daemon

The NavisAI daemon is the local control plane responsible for:

- device pairing (mobile / desktop)
- project discovery and classification
- terminal + AI session orchestration
- approvals and human-in-the-loop actions
- IPC between CLI, PWA, and local services

This directory contains **structure only**.
Behavior is introduced incrementally via normal commits.
